# maRio

* I want to use R to its advantages (data manipulation, modeling, viz, etc.) and then host my work on a website. 
* I want to do this without recreating my work in JS plotting libraries
* I will use Plumber to turn my R objects into REST API endpoints to be called from my website where needed.
